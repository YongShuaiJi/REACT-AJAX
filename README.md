# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

#### 基本要点
- ES6 小知识
```
let obj = {a:{b:1}}
const {a} = obj; // 传统解构赋值
const {a:{b}} = obj; // 连续解构赋值
const {a:{b: value}} = obj // 连续解构赋值 + 重命名
```

- 消息订阅与发布
1、 先订阅在发布，是一种对话的设计思想；与消息中间件的设计思想略微有些差异，消息中间件给人的设计感觉可以解决高并发大批量的对话，设计更加全面和复杂，前端的消息订阅与发布，设计思路更偏向于简单的人与人之间对话，更加简单、简洁。
2、对话完成后便可以在 componentWillUnmount 中取消订阅 
3、React18 严格模式下的componentDidMount会重复执行两次（在开发环境中），可以在组件包围外侧去掉 <React.StrictMode> 即可

- fetch 发送请求
除了XHR以外，前端的另外一种处理http请求的方式，但是一些老版本的浏览器不支持
